# Obesity Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **obesity levels** using machine learning techniques based on individual lifestyle, physical, and dietary factors.  
The goal is to analyze the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance to identify obesity risk categories.
